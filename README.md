## A Constellation Map

`stars.txt` contains `x y z HD magnitude HR` of every star.

- `x` `y` and `z` are normalized cartesian coordinates of the star relative to Earth.

- `HD` is the Henry Draper number of the star.

- `magnitude` is the apparent brightness (V).

- `HR` is the Harvard Revised number which is not used in this project.
